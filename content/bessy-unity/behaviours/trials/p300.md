title: P300 Trial Behaviours
---
Several P300 flashing methods are implemented in provided trial behaviours, all of which use a [`StimulusPresenterCollection`](../../stimulus/collections/_index.md) and expect simple stimulus presentation to toggle on and quickly off again. Use of the standard [`ColourToggleStimulusPresenter`](../../stimulus/presentation/standard.md#colour-toggle-stimulus-presenter) is implied (but not required).

## Single Flash
These trial behaviours trigger a single presenter at a time, sending [single flash markers](../../../framework/markers.md#event-markers). The base `SingleFlashTrialBehaviour` flashes presenters in a random order.

### Context-Aware Single Flash
Triggers only visible presenters in a placement-optimized sequence.


## Multi-Flash
These trial behaviours trigger multiple presenters simultaneously, sending [multi-flash markers](../../../framework/markers.md#event-markers).

### Grid
Provides shared fields to grid based flashing patterns (row-column and checkerboard). *Proper functioning of these behaviours relies on the referenced presenters being indexed in order of arrangement*.

#### Row-Column
Triggers an entire row or column of presenters in turn.

#### Checkerboard
Triggers varied sets of non-adjacent presenters, collected like the alternating black and white tiles of a checkerboard.

### Context-Aware Multi Flash
Triggers varied sets of non-adjacent visible presenters, collected according to position.
